          The project proposes the redesign of Roger Neilson House's webpage, a palliative care facility in Ottawa. User research, including interviews and surveys, was conducted to gather insights. Competitor analysis highlighted strengths in accessibility standards, but weaknesses were found in certain websites. Heuristic evaluation identified issues with images, contact information, page length, and font size. User perspectives, actions, feelings, and pain points were considered. The problem statement focused on saving user information to streamline the volunteer application process. Sketches were created, and the site map was adjusted to include an 'About Us' section. A UI style guide was developed based on user preferences. Next steps included incorporating features, adding a contact form, and improving accessibility.

        The non-profit organization's website faced issues with cluttered navigation, outdated information, and limited resource access. Steps taken to address the problem included a heuristic analysis and usability testing. Insights led to a redesign of the information architecture, improvements in the footer design, and the creation of mockups and a UI style guide. The resulting solution aimed to provide a clearer purpose, intuitive navigation, and easier access to resources. Future steps involve finalizing prototypes and perfecting the footer design.
